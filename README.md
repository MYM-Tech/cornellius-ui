## Branch naming convention

You branch should have a name that reflects it's purpose.

It should always start by the type of work you'll do (`feat`, `chore`, `build`, `fix`, `docs`, `refacto`), followed by a slash (`/`) and a very quick summary of the subject in [kebab case][1].

Example: `feat/add-user-company`.
